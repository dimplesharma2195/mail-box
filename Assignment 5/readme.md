# Compose and send Mail

## Deliverable

- Build a screen like this where users can create mails and send it to other users.

- Choose the text editor node module package wisely from the internet, so that users can make their text bold and highlight them as well. I Recommend this package -> this text editor.

- Once the user has finished typing the user can send the mail to the mail id specified by the user.

- [If you know Node JS] - Design your own backend api to store the emails accordingly and do a POST request from frontend

- [If you dont know Node JS] - Make a post request to the firebase api route and store the email smartly.

- [Keep in mind] that you store the mails in such a way that the reciever of the mail can easily retrieve the mails sent to him by his mail id.

- [Keep in mind] The sender of the mail should also be able to retreieve it in his sentbox by his mail id.

- Push the code to git and upload the commit ID.
